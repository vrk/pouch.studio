# Zines

I love making zines that play with the expectation of what a zine is supposed to be. For instance: a half-paper, half-digital interactive story; a sticker book; a full-color magazine. But I also sometimes just draw the Shark Tank intro.

      A story that's <em>possibly</em> about turning into a printer. A choose-your-own-adventure-style zine with 5 different endings!!

    <p>Toaster (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/toaster.vision/" target="_blank">@toaster.vision</a>) is my friend's cat who is very stickerable. So with my friend's blessing (and Toaster's blessing), I made this zine!</p>
    <p>This is a sticker book of Toaster's adventures. Each picture of Toaster is actually a sticker! 2.75" x 3.5" staple-bound booklet.</p>
    <p>Features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>12 pages printed in black & white
      <li>7 full-color vinyl stickers 
      <li>Easy-peel stickers: the white outline is the backing of the sticker (not part of the sticker itself), so each Toaster sticker comes off easily!
    </ul>
