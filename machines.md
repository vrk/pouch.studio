# Machines

I enjoy building simple machines! Here are a few of them:

- [Dogs of Fate](https://vrklovespaper.substack.com/p/i-have-improved-at-design#%C2%A7dogs-of-fate): A receipt printer fortune-telling machine ft. 100 dogs.

- [Christine Botts](/machines/cbotts): Christine Betts as a talking paper doll.

- [Hourly GitHub Dog](https://arc.net/e/7C7EE0A9-591B-4C5F-859A-7FA24AA7F258): Replaces the GitHub UI with a new dog every hour. _(The machine part is really [this bot](https://github.com/vrk/gh4b) posting [these changes](https://github.com/vrk/gh4b/commits/main/) hourly.)_
