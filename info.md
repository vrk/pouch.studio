Hello!! I'm Victoria, aka vrk! I live in Brooklyn, NY and I am a software engineer who loves paper. _(For my engineering resume, see [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoriakirst/).)_

Pouch Studio is the home of my independent creative lab. I make zines, I make software, I make machines, I make tools, I make crafts, I write. Pouch Studio is where I publish this work!

Sometimes I look like

But frequently I actually look like this:

Here are some areas that are top of mind for me these days:

### üî® Paper as tool

I am an engineer at heart, and I am fascinated by paper as a medium. Of course, I also love software and all the conveniences it brings - but I do not think software is always a more convenient and effective medium than paper.

Software excels at providing infinity: infinite choices, infinite chances, infinite undos and redos and undos again. But infinity has its downsides: infinite distractions, infinite content, paralysis and isolation in a sea of noise.

Paper, on the other hand, is decidedly finite. It is tangible. It remembers your pencil strokes, even after erasing. It wrinkles, it ages. I don't think of these qualities as "limitations"; rather, they are part of what enables paper to solve different problems than software can.

- I can only fit so many to-dos on a sticky note. Because of this, I have to keep my to-do list relatively short. Is this always a bad thing?
- If I print out a recipe on paper, I can still grab it when my hands are covered in flour. Is the same true for a recipe on my phone or laptop?
- When I draw or write by hand, I can only erase and start over so many times before the paper starts to deteriorate. Because of this, I am nudged to just keep going with what I have and move on to the next page. Is this a limitation?
- On Pinterest, Instagram, and TikTok, I can save unlimited pins, posts, videos and hoard infinite inspiration. Is this always a benefit? On the other hand, if I print out a picture that inspires me, I have to see it and interact with it, and if I get tired of it I have to throw it out. Is that a bad thing?


### üß∏ Software & hardware as toy

I love making machines whose only point is to make you (or me) (or us) smile.


### üìñ Writing for readers

I love writing that is easy and fun to read. When you receive my newsletter, I want you to be excited to open it. I want you to read it quickly without effort. It shouldn't feel like eating vegetables!

Ô∏èSimilarly, with _Pouch_, I strive to make a magazine where it's common for someone to read every single word in the issue. It should be a joy to read, the way you look forward to the next episode of a beloved TV show. This shouldn't be so unusual!

### ü©µ Hand-crafted and heartfelt

I love things that are clearly made by a person, whether it's software, an email, a drawing, a note. Woven within these handmade things are layers of personality and expression that cannot be imitated any other way. They provide a connection between creator and receiver that can be surprisingly profound.

Because of that, I'm pretty <em>un</em>interested in most* applications of generative AI. (And I'm outright against the use of generative AI that has been trained using the work of artists without their consent.) I think a lot of generative AI is like those TikTok face filters, but for your words, drawings, and thoughts. I don't think using a TikTok filter is bad per se, but your face through a filter is also not your face.

I want to make it easier for people to make handmade and heartfelt things - not by auto-generation via buttons and prompts (those are not your face), but by the same thoughtful instruction, tooling, and community that has helped me grow my own artistic practice. 

_*I'm not saying all AI is bad/uninteresting, generative or otherwise._
