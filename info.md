<div class="spacey">

Hello!! I'm Victoria, aka vrk! I live in Brooklyn, NY  and I am a software engineer who loves paper. _(For my engineering resume, see [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victoriakirst/).)_

As an engineer, I respect paper as a tool that can solve certain problems far better than software can. A cheap printed photo, or a wobbly handwritten message, can hold within it a startling amount of life, in a way that is unique to the medium itself.

I am interested in exploring the medium of paper itself and how to push "paper" forward as both tool and toy, expecially through objects like zines and stickers and journals.



I am generally interested in the following things:

- Paper as a tool
- Paper as a toy
- Friendly machines
- Exploring software that enhances one's ability to create, express, and connect with paper
- Telling stories
