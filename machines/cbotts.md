# Christine Botts

My friend Christine couldn't make it to our friend Tami's 30th birthday, so Christine and I collaborated on a talking paper doll of Christine which we named Christine Botts. Christine provided the photos and audio; I put together the machine. Made in about ~2 hours.

Press the button and Christine says a phrase!

Christine Botts has accessories, including a bday hat and cake:
